## Backend

**Project developed in the 2nd semester (Grade: 1.3)**  

- Implemented in **JavaScript** using the **Express framework** and **Node.js**  
- Used **JSON** as a database substitute, since databases were introduced later in the 4th semester  
- (Note: This backend project is **not related** to the uploaded frontend â€“ they were separate assignments)
